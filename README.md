## üìò **Getting Started**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jjateen/8051.git
   cd 8051
   ```

2. **Open the Projects in Keil ŒºVision:**
   - Import the `.c` files and build the project to generate the hex file.

3. **Simulate Using Proteus:**
   - Use the hex file generated from Keil ŒºVision to simulate the circuit with the ACT89C51 microcontroller.

4. **Burn the Hex File:**
   - Use Flash Magic to upload the hex file onto your 8051 microcontroller.
